## Ionic Compounds
### Simple Ionic Compounds
Ionic compounds with metals from Group 1, Group 2, and aluminum.
The cation (positively charged, generally a metal) is named first, and are named the same way as the parent element.
The anion (negatively charged, usually a non-metal) are named second, and the suffix -ide is used.

  For example, the compound KBr is made up of the ions <strong>K<sup>+</sup></strong> and <strong>Br<sup>-</sup></strong>.

  K<sup>+</sup> (the <em>postassium ion</em>) is called <strong>postassium</strong>
  Br<sup>-</sup> is called <strong>bromide</strong>
  It is important to remember that on the periodic table, Br represents an atom of the element bromine, but that the particle in the compound is the **ion** Br<sup>-</sup>, which we refer to as *bromide*.  These are note the same thing!

The compound is called <em>potassium bromide</em>.

Numerical prefixes, such as mono-,di-, tri-, etc. are not used for this type of compound.  This is because the metals in these compounds only form one type of ion.

  * Metals from Group 1 form +1 ions only.
  * Metals from Group 2 form +2 ions only.
  * Aluminum froms 3 form +3 ions only.

At the same time, the non-metals generally form only one type of anion.

* The halogens (Group 17: F, Cl, Br, I) only form -1 ions.
* Oxygen and sulfur form only -2 ions.
* Nitrogen and phosphorus form only -3 ions.

Since ionic compounds must be electrically neutral, the total of thecharges on the cations (+) has to be equal to the total charges on the anions (-).  We can use this to decide how many cations and anions are present in the compound.

#### Writing formulas from names

Consider the compound calcium fluoride.
Because calcium is in Group 2 it will form an ion with a 2+ charge, Ca<sup>2+</sup> in an ionic compound.
Fluoride is the anion of *fluorine*, which is in Group 17, and has a -1 charge.  Fluoride is F<sup>-</sup>.

For the charges to balance, there must be two fluoride ions for each calcium ion.  Therefore the formula for calcium fluoride is CaF<sub>2</sub>.

### Ionic Compounds with Polyatomic Ions

There is a category of ions that are made up of more than one atom (usually non-metals) covalently bonded together, and the whole ensemble carries a charge.  These are known as *polyatomic ions*. The formulae of these ions must be ***memorized***.  Below is a list of common polyatomic ions that you should know by heart.

You may sometimes come across compounds such as NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, where the polyatomic ion carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) is paired with a sodium ion and a hydrogen ion.  This compound is called *sodium hydrogen carbonate*.

### Ionic Compounds Containing Transition Metals

Transition metals (those found in groups 3-12 on the periodic table) are often able to form more than one type of ion.  For example iron can form both +2 and +3 ions.

We need to change how we name ionic compounds!  

For example, both of these ions can form compounds with, say chloride ions:

Fe<sup>2+</sup> will combine with chloride ion to form FeCl<sub>2</sub>.
Fe<sup>3+</sup> will combine with chloride ion to form FeCl<sub>3</sub>.

We can't call both of these compounds iron chloride!

To show the difference, we indicate the charge of the metal ion by writing it as a roman numeral after the name of the metal.

FeCl<sub>2</sub> is named iron(II) chloride.
FeCl<sub>3</sub> is named iron(III) chloride.

Numerical prefixes are not used.

### Hydrated Ionic Compounds

Many ionic compounds absorb water from the atmosphere and become *hydrated*.  This means that water molecules are included in the solid.  Therefore, the mass of the water molecules must be included in the molar mass of the compound.  This is especially important when you are calculating the number of moles of a hydrated ionic compound after weighing it in the lab.

Cobalt(II) chloride is one such compound.  The anhydrous compound is blue, and has a molar mass of 129.83 g/mol.  When exposed to the atmosphere, this compound will absorb six water molecules for each unit of cobalt(II) chloride.  The hydrated compound is red, and has a molar mass of 237.93 g/mol.

Hydrated ionic compounds are named just like their anhydrous counterpart, but the number of water molecules is indicated by adding the word *hydrate* with a numerical prefix after the regular name.
