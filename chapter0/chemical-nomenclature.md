## Ionic Compounds
### Simple Ionic Compounds
Ionic compounds with metals from Group 1, Group 2, and aluminum.
The cation (positively charged, generally a metal) is named first, and are named the same way as the parent element.
The anion (negatively charged, usually a non-metal) are named second, and the suffix -ide is used.

  For example, the compound KBr is made up of the ions <strong>K<sup>+</sup></strong> and <strong>Br<sup>-</sup></strong>.

  K<sup>+</sup> (the <em>postassium ion</em>) is called <strong>postassium</strong>
  Br<sup>-</sup> is called <strong>bromide</strong>
  It is important to remember that on the periodic table, Br represents an atom of the element bromine, but that the particle in the compound is the **ion** Br<sup>-</sup>, which we refer to as *bromide*.  These are note the same thing!

The compound is called <em>potassium bromide</em>.

Numerical prefixes, such as mono-,di-, tri-, etc. are not used for this type of compound.  This is because the metals in these compounds only form one type of ion.

  * Metals from Group 1 form +1 ions only.
  * Metals from Group 2 form +2 ions only.
  * Aluminum froms 3 form +3 ions only.

At the same time, the non-metals generally form only one type of anion.

* The halogens (Group 17: F, Cl, Br, I) only form -1 ions.
* Oxygen and sulfur form only -2 ions.
* Nitrogen and phosphorus form only -3 ions.

Since ionic compounds must be electrically neutral, the total of thecharges on the cations (+) has to be equal to the total charges on the anions (-).  We can use this to decide how many cations and anions are present in the compound.

#### Writing formulas from names

Consider the compound calcium fluoride.
Because calcium is in Group 2 it will form an ion with a 2+ charge, Ca<sup>2+</sup> in an ionic compound.
Fluoride is the anion of *fluorine*, which is in Group 17, and has a -1 charge.  Fluoride is F<sup>-</sup>.

For the charges to balance, there must be two fluoride ions for each calcium ion.  Therefore the formula for calcium fluoride is CaF<sub>2</sub>.
